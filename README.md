## CariSurg Week 0 Portfolio – Data Cleaning, Data Visualization and Clinical Context Assignments

This repository contains my Week 0 submissions for the CariSurg MedTech Pathways Program.

The assignments focused on developing fundamental data cleaning, data visualization, and clinical interpretation skills using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The goal was to identify inconsistencies, handle missing values, validate data quality, prepare datasets for analysis, create meaningful visualizations, and understand the clinical significance of healthcare data.

# Assignment 1 – Gender Column Cleaning

## Objective

The objective of this assignment was to clean and standardize the Gender column in the Emergency Triage Dataset.

## Tasks Completed

- Loaded the dataset into Google Colab
- Inspected the Gender column
- Identified inconsistent gender values
- Standardized gender entries into a consistent format
- Exported the cleaned dataset

# Assignment 2 – Pulse Column Cleaning

## Objective

The objective of this assignment was to clean the Pulse column by identifying missing values, detecting unrealistic pulse readings, and preparing the data for further analysis.

## Cleaning Process

### 1. Initial Inspection

The Pulse column was inspected using frequency counts to understand the distribution of values and identify unusual entries.

### 2. Numeric Conversion

The Pulse column was converted to numeric format using Pandas. Invalid or non-numeric values were converted to missing values (NaN).

### 3. Missing Value Detection

Missing values were identified using data validation checks.

**Result:**

- Missing values after numeric conversion: 44

### 4. Out-of-Range Detection

A valid physiological pulse range of 40–170 beats per minute (bpm) was established.

Values outside this range were considered unrealistic and replaced with NaN.

**Result:**

- Out-of-range pulse values detected: 43

### 5. Median Imputation

Missing values were replaced using the median pulse value.

The median was selected because it is less sensitive to extreme values and outliers than the mean.

**Result:**

- Median pulse value used: 90 bpm

### 6. Validation

After cleaning, the dataset was validated using descriptive statistics and visual inspection.

**Results:**

- Missing values remaining: 0
- Minimum pulse value: 40 bpm
- Maximum pulse value: 170 bpm

# Assignment 3 – Data Visualization

## Objective

The objective of this assignment was to create meaningful clinical visualizations using the Emergency Triage Dataset.

The Pulse column was selected because heart rate is an important vital sign used in emergency medicine to assess circulation, cardiovascular function, and patient stability.

The Pulse column was cleaned and validated during Assignment 2 before being used for visualization and analysis.

## Visualizations Created

### 1. Pulse Distribution Histogram

**Clinical Question:**

How are pulse rates distributed among Emergency Department patients?

A histogram was used to visualize the distribution of pulse values throughout the dataset.

A clinical reference line was added at:

- 100 bpm (Tachycardia Threshold)

This threshold helps identify patients whose pulse rates may indicate elevated cardiovascular stress or other clinical concerns.

### 2. Age vs Pulse Scatter Plot

**Clinical Question:**

Does age affect resting heart rate in Emergency Department patients?

A scatter plot was used to explore the relationship between Age and Pulse.

Clinical reference lines were added at:

- 60 bpm (Lower Normal Pulse)
- 100 bpm (Upper Normal Pulse)

These lines provide clinical context when interpreting heart rate measurements.

## Results

- Most pulse values were concentrated between approximately 80 and 100 bpm.
- Some patients exhibited pulse values above the tachycardia threshold.
- No strong visible relationship between age and pulse was observed.
- The visualizations demonstrated how cleaned healthcare data can be used to generate meaningful clinical insights.
